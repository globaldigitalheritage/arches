### Arches 4.3.3 release notes

The Arches team has been busy improving Arches and fixing several bugs as well.
Below you'll find a listing of all the changes that are included in the latest release.

Some of the highlights:
- Fixes duplicate entries in cards_x_nodes_x_widgets

#### Known Issues

- [#4044](https://github.com/archesproject/arches/issues/4044) - Exporting data that uses the File-list datatype in csv format can't be successfully re-imported.  

  **Workaround:** If users need to export data that uses the File-list datatype, then they should export in JSON format instead, so that data can be successfully re-imported.

#### Upgrading Arches

Users are encouraged to update at their earliest convenience.  Completely re-installing Arches is the easiest way to accomplish this.

If you can't completely re-install Arches (because you have data in the system that you want to preserve) then you'll need to upgrade by running the following commands in your activated virtual environment:

```
pip install arches --upgrade --no-binary :all:
python manage.py migrate
```

If you have Arches running on a web server such as Apache, be sure to update your static files directory and restart your web server.

As always the documentation can be found at <http://arches.readthedocs.io>
